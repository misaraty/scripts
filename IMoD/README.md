## Usage

* The `./example` directory contains three complete example datasets used in the paper: `energetics`, `BACE`, and `permeability`.

* To migrate to a custom dataset, place `Sequence_v1.2.py`, `Diffusion_v1.2.py`, and `D.csv` in the same directory. The filename can be changed by modifying `DATA_CSV = "D.csv"`. D.csv` must contain two columns: `SMILES`: molecular representation; `D`: target property. The label column matching rule can be modified via `r"(^|[^A-Za-z])D([^A-Za-z]|$)|label|target"`.

* The execution commands are `python Sequence_v1.2.py` and `python Diffusion_v1.2.py`, respectively.

* `TARGET_D` in `equence_v1.2.py` and `Diffusion_v1.2.pyS` represents the target property value expected for the generated molecules. In `Diffusion_v1.2.py`, `GRAPH_N_MAX` and `GEODIFF_N_MAX` should be set to the maximum number of atoms (including the hydrogenated structure), while `GRAPH_ATOMS` specifies the types of elements considered.

> [!NOTE]
> `chemprop` uses `v1.6.1`; the calling method differs between `Windows` and `Ubuntu`, and both `Sequence_v1.2.py` and `Diffusion_v1.2.py` support the two platforms.
>
> To avoid an oversized repository, the `./example` directory does not include `*.pt` files. If needed, the corresponding `*.pt` files can be obtained via email (misaraty@163.com) or regenerated by running the scripts.
